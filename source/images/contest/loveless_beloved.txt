For my favorite comic
A poem by Renee Cardineau

There's a comic that I know
I found it years ago
And not once since the beginning
Has this comic grown old.

This comic is my friend
With every new page up
Each storyline amazing
I cannot get enough.

My fingers know the name
I type it in my sleep
And never in a comics life
Has my love been this deep.

I go when there's no update
Just to stare the last one down
And read the entries written
And new comments that I've found.

And to every other reader
That I've met along the way
I've no doubt that if I asked you
This is what you'd say

“My fingers know the name
I type it in my sleep
And never in a comics life
Has my love been this deep.

“And with every picture saved
And every quoted line
I wish I could stay “hostile”
All of the time”
